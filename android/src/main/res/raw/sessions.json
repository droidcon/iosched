Fortunately, Google created HOLO, which quickly went mainstream as companies realised a proper Android design approach was essential.\r\n\r\nStephan will cover the emergence of HOLO, the impact it had on the design philosophy of Runtastic, and how it improved Runtastic\u2019s apps, as well as demonstrating how Runtastic\u2019s designers create clean and easy mock-ups that inspire the rest of the team. Finally, you\u2019ll learn how HOLO influenced Runtastic app design on other platforms \u2013 a valuable piece of information if you\u2019re looking to expand!\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn how to create top-quality, easy-to-use apps by putting skeuomorphism on the shelf and using clean design elements, this is the ideal presentation for you!","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382690700,"presenterIds":["23"],"endTimestamp":1382693400},{"id":"26","title":"Fist of Awesome","location":"2","description":"Nicoll Hunt\u2019s indie game project Fist of Awesome smashed through its Kickstarter funding targets in just 14 days, after a flurry of word of mouth and media attention \u2013 find out what that was like at Nicoll\u2019s talk! He\u2019ll demo his progress, talk about what it\u2019s like to run a Kickstarter project, the challenges of developing a game simultaneously on Android and iOS, his involvement in the new OUYA Android-based TV console and why he went full circle from working for big companies back to bedroom coding. If you\u2019re thinking of going solo, starting a Kickstarter project, or just want to be a success in indie gaming, this is the place to be!","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382693400,"presenterIds":["25"],"endTimestamp":1382696100},{"id":"33","title":"Responsive design for Android","location":"3","description":"With the expansion in different Android devices, it\u2019s no longer enough to design Android apps for just phone and tablet forms: apps on Android need to scale to a continuum of screen sizes, not just two. Web apps have faced the same issue for years and are now designed to be responsive, meaning that they adapt intelligently to any screen size. All the best Android apps follow the same principles, and combined with Android\u2019s powerful tools, apps can be built to support any device \u2013 find out how to get yours up to scratch!","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382693400,"presenterIds":["32"],"endTimestamp":1382696100},{"id":"35","title":"Case Studies in Android design","location":"3","description":"Join Jamie McDonald for a  tour of Android\u2019s design landscape, including patterns, tips, techniques and tools, grounded in real world examples.

Players don\u2019t dedicate so much time or mind-space to playing games on their phone as they do when they sit down for a console or PC game play session. Game developers for mobile devices must learn how to satisfy this new kind of gamer and even take advantage of the evolution in play patterns to create new and innovative styles of game. Jason Avent has directed games on both console and mobile platforms and so is ideally placed to observe the differences. He has demonstrated that console teams can successfully move to mobile with the breakout hit, CSR Racing.","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382697000,"presenterIds":["27"],"endTimestamp":1382699700},{"id":"37","title":"Android Animations","location":"3","description":"Join Mark Allison to learn about the animation APIs available within Android, and how you can add polish to your apps to make them stand out from the crowd!","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382699700,"presenterIds":["36"],"endTimestamp":1382702400},{"id":"29","title":"Open Mic - Gaming problems and solutions, share your experiences!","location":"2","description":"An open mic session for people to raise problems they've had writing games on Android and for others to offer up solutions.

Rajawali is a 3D framework for Android based on OpenGL ES 2.0 and written in pure Java. It abstracts all the complicated OpenGL bits. This presentation will also benefit people who are unfamiliar with 3D. I will be going over the basics and I will also cover optimisation, common techniques used in 3D, animation and interaction.","subtype":"SESSION","startTimestamp":1382708700,"presenterIds":["30"],"endTimestamp":1382711400}]}
