Such code can be recovered from both local or remote containers. This technique has clear advantages, as minimizing code occupancy in memory or helping deploy \u201csilent updates\u201d to decouple updates of our app from those of its third-party libraries.<br \/>\nUnluckily some drawbacks in terms of security are also carried out. Firstly, malware authors may use dynamic code loading (DCL) to bypass antivirus checks by loading malicious code at runtime after that an apparently benign APK has been installed. Secondly, native Android API do not implement any kind of integrity check on DCL. This means that a remote attacker, that succeeds in modifying the bytecode of the APK or JAR container specified as source for DCL, will, not only, not been caught but also see his repackaged code kindly executed by the Dalvik VM. This kind of vulnerabilities was found in 9.25% of apps present on Play Store in 2012. In our opinion devs should not be required to be security or crypto experts and that&#8217;s why we think that API should abstract security details by implementing the best practices in a truly transparent way for devs.<br \/>\nIn this talk an overview on this issue will be depicted alongside with Grab&#8217;n Run, an open-source drop-in library that wraps current DexClassLoader API with an extra layer and makes DCL easier, safe and secure.<\/p>\n"},{"post_title":"Kick-start your experience with Android Wear","url":"http:\/\/it.droidcon.com\/2015\/sessions\/kick-start-your-experience-with-android-wear\/","time":"15:20","end_time":"16:00","date":"9 April 2015","location":"Sala Londra","color":"","track":["androidwear","Development","Wearable"],"speakers":[{"post_title":"Mario Viviani","featured":"","url":"http:\/\/it.droidcon.com\/2015\/speakers\/mario-viviani\/","post_image":"http:\/\/it.droidcon.com\/2015\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/02\/mario-viviani-150x150.jpeg","header":"CEO at Mariux Apps, Google Developer Expert","speaker_id":"791","bio":"<p>Mario Viviani, Android Developer since 2010, has been nominated Google Developer Expert (GDE) for Android by Google in 2013.

Per questo motivo sono sempre pi\u00f9 gli studi che tentano di progettare metodi di interazione e interfacce pi\u00f9 user friendly e pi\u00f9 consone a tali dispositivi. Uno studio di usabilit\u00e0 molto attento durante la fase di progettazione di una interfaccia utente pu\u00f2 portare al successo di un\u2019applicazione e migliorare l\u2019esperienza d\u2019uso. \u00c8 dunque preferibile studiare e progettare interfacce innovative che sfruttino a pieno le potenzialit\u00e0 di questi device, facendo attenzione a non replicare le interfacce classiche che vengono utilizzare sui normali sistemi desktop e laptop, poich\u00e9 poco finger friendly.

Il secondo invece ha un\u2019interfaccia utente innovativa priva icone o men\u00f9, in questo caso l\u2019utente pu\u00f2 interagire con l\u2019applicazione solo tramite gesture.
